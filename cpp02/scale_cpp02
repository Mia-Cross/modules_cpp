The Fixed class (or whatever its name) must provide accessors to
the raw value:
  - int getRawBits( void ) const;
  - void setRawBits(int const raw );
Are these member functions present and functional?

A canonical class must provide at least:
  - A default constructor
  - A destructor
  - A copy constructor
  - An assignation operator
Are these elements present and functional?

Is it possible to construct an instance from a floating point value?

Is there a << operator overload and is it functional?

A member function "int toInt( void ) const;" that converts the
fixed point value to an integer value must be present. Is it functional?

A member function \"float toFloat( void ) const;\" that converts
the fixed point value to a float value must be present. Is it functional?

Is it possible to construct an instance from an integer value?

#################  EX_02  #################
The class must provide a division operator. Is it present and functional?
The class must provide addition and substraction operators. Are they present and functional?
The class must provide the pre-increment, post-increment, pre-decrement
and post-decrement operators, that will increment or decrement the fixed point
value from the smallest representable\\x0F such as 1 + \\x0F > 1. Are they present
and are they functional?

The class must provide a multiplication operator. Is it present and
functional?

The class must provide 4 non member functions: min, max and their const overloads. Are they present and are they functional?
The class must provide 6 comparison operators: \>, <, >=, <=, == and !=.
Are they present and functional?

Test the interpreter with more and more complex expressions. Start
with values, then move to simple addtion, multiplications, then test complex
expressions with parenthesis.
